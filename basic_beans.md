# Basic Pot of Beans


### Soak
1. 2 to 24 hours before cooking the beans, leave them out to soak.
1. Give the beans a good rinse. In a stockpot of a large bowl, cover the beans
   in 3-4 inches of water. Add 1-2 tbs of salt. 

### Prep
1. Dice one large onion, small as possible. Mince 3 medium sized cloves of
   garlic, as small as possible.

**Alternative:** If you would rather not have pieces of vegetables in the soup,
cut the onion into quarters (skinned with nubs removed). Add the garlic cloves
whole. Fish them out after the beans are mostly done cooking.

### Cook

1. In a large stockpot, heat up ~3 tbs of good olive oil over medium heat. Once
   slightly shimmering, add the onion. Cook the onion for 3-5 minutes, barely
   becoming transluscent. Add the garlic. Allow the garlic to cook for another
   minute.  Avoid browning of the garlic.
1. Add the beans and their soaking water. Bring to a hard boil for 15 minutes.
   After, reduce to a simmer.
1. Check the beans after 40 minutes to 1 hour. Beans which are undercooked will
   still be either hard or grainy. Fully cooked beans should be creamy and soft.
   Cooking will take between 40 minutes and 2 hours after an overnight soak.
1. If the beans are almost fully cooked, at this point taste for salt.
1. If time permits, allow the beans to return to room temperature in their
   cooking water.


### Notes on Royal Coronas
1. If removed from heat too suddenly, the skin will break and peel back. Allow
   to cool slowly in their cooking water.
